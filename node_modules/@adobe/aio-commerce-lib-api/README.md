# `@adobe/aio-commerce-lib-api`

A set of utilities to build HTTP/API clients for Adobe I/O Events and Adobe Commerce APIs.

This library provides a unified interface for building HTTP clients that can communicate with Adobe Commerce (both SaaS and PaaS) and Adobe I/O Events APIs, with built-in authentication support and a flexible API function binding system.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @adobe/aio-commerce-lib-api
```

## Usage

See the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md) for more information.

## Architecture

The library is built on top of [Ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky), a modern HTTP client based on Fetch API, providing:

- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Request/response hooks
- Timeout support
- JSON parsing
- Error handling

The authentication layer integrates seamlessly with `@adobe/aio-commerce-lib-auth`, automatically handling:

- OAuth 1.0a signatures for PaaS instances
- Bearer token authentication for SaaS instances
- IMS token management and refresh
